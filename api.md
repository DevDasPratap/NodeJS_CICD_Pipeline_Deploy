📌 **API & REST API Fundamentals:**
REST APIs: The foundation of modern web development  
  
As a software engineer, I have always been passionate about sharing my knowledge and helping others to understand complex technical concepts. That's why I was so excited to create this small presentation on REST API.  
  
For those who may not know, a REST API (which stands for Representational State Transfer API) is a way for different software systems to communicate with each other through the internet.  
  
It's a crucial component of modern software development, and something that every aspiring developer should understand.  
  
Imagine you're trying to book a flight online. When you search for flights and enter your preferences, the website sends a request to the airline's computer system to find available flights that match your criteria. The airline's system then sends a response back to the website with the available flights, and you can choose one to book. This interaction between the website and the airline's system is made possible through a REST API.  
  
There are five main methods used in a REST API:  
  
GET - retrieves a specific resource or collection of resources  
POST - creates a new resource  
PUT - updates an existing resource  
DELETE - removes a specific resource  
PATCH - partially updates an existing resource  
  
The response from a REST API can either be a success or an error. A success response typically includes the requested information or a message confirming that the requested action was completed. An error response includes a message explaining why the request could not be completed.  
  
Overall, a REST API is a crucial tool for allowing different software systems to communicate with each other and exchange information seamlessly.  
  
If you're working with software systems or just want to understand how different websites and apps work together, it's important to understand the basics of REST APIs.  
  
I know firsthand how confusing and overwhelming it can be to learn about new technologies, especially when you're just starting out in the field. That's why I wanted to create this presentation - to provide a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand explanation of what a REST API is and how it works.  
  
I hope that this presentation will be helpful to those who are new to software development, or who are simply looking to learn more about APIs. And I plan to keep creating more such documents in the future, so that all the needy and new enthusiasts out there can benefit from my knowledge and experience.  
  
So if you're interested in learning more about APIs, or if you have any questions or feedback about this presentation, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to help, and I'm committed to doing my part to make the world of software development more accessible and understandable to everyone.

**📌 API Methods:**
🚀 Master 9 HTTP methods in just 9 minutes and stand out in 2023!  
  
🔸 As a developer, it's always important to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and skills.  
  
🔸 While it may seem like knowing just 4-5 REST API HTTP methods is enough, the reality is that there are actually 39 different verbs or methods available.  
  
🌀 However, if you want to set yourself apart in the job market in 2023, it's crucial to master at least 9 of these methods.

**📌 REST API vs GraphQL:**
Stay ahead of the curve learning GraphQL: the modern, flexible alternative to REST APIs.  
  
As we gear up for another new year, I wanted to share some thoughts on a topic that I think will be crucial for developers in 2023: GraphQL.  
  
If you're not already familiar with GraphQL, it's a query language for your API that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, and nothing more. This means that you can get all the data you need in a single request, rather than having to make multiple API calls to get all the data you need.  
  
But why is this important? Well, for one thing, GraphQL can help improve the performance of your applications. With REST APIs, you often have to make multiple API calls to get all the data you need, which can be slow and resource-intensive.  
  
With GraphQL, you can get all the data you need in a single request, which can greatly improve the performance of your application.  
  
Another reason to learn GraphQL is that it can help improve the flexibility of your API. With REST APIs, you often have to design your API around the needs of your clients. This can be a problem if your clients have very different data needs, as you may have to design multiple endpoints to accommodate them all.  
  
With GraphQL, clients can request exactly the data they need, which makes it much easier to design a flexible API that can accommodate a wide range of client needs.  
  
So if you're a developer looking to stay on top of the latest trends in the field, learning GraphQL is definitely worth considering in 2023.  
  
And if you're not familiar with the difference between REST APIs and GraphQL, the attached illustration should help demystify things for you.

**📌 API Integration:**
API integration made easy - Learn in just 5 minutes and stay ahead of the curve!  
  
  
In today's digital age, understanding API integration has become increasingly important for businesses and developers alike.  
  
But what exactly are APIs and why is API integration ?  
  
APIs, or application programming interfaces, act as a bridge between different software systems and allow them to communicate with each other.  
  
API integration refers to the process of connecting different software systems through APIs in order to share data and functionality.  
  
Examples of API integration can be seen in many everyday tools and platforms.  
  
Social media apps, for example, often use APIs to connect to other apps like Google Maps or Instagram to share information and functionality.  
  
E-commerce platforms also use APIs to connect to payment gateways and shipping providers.  
  
The API integration process typically involves designing and building the API, testing it, and then integrating it with other systems.

**📌 Designing and Developing Robust APIs:**
If you are facing difficulty with designing high-quality APIs, steal this API formula. 👇  
🎨 Here are some ways to simplify your API design and make it easy to use: ✔️  
  
Simplicity is key in design, especially when it comes to API design.  
  
Keep the KISS principle in mind - "Keep It Simple, Stupid." 🔸  
  
👉 Ensure that anyone can use the API without having to refer to the documentation.  
  
👉 Use standard, concrete, and shared terms that are familiar to most people.  
  
👉 Allow application developers to do things in only one way, rather than offering multiple confusing options.  
  
👉 Design the API with the needs of the client (application developers) in mind.  
  
👉 Focus on the major use cases for the API first, and address exceptional cases later on.  
  
For example, using the GET requests listed below, someone using the API should be able to easily retrieve orders, users, and products without having to refer to documentation or understand specialized terms: 🌀  
  
GET /orders  
GET /users  
GET /products  
  
And they should be able to do so in a consistent way, rather than having to remember multiple different methods or options for each type of data. 🤝
