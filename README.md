### GitHub Actions - NodeJS Project | CI/CD Pipeline and Deploying on Heroku | DevOps Tutorial

I  introduce how you can set up Github Actions for a NodeJS project that allows you to include CI/CD capabilities to Build, Test and Auto Deploy our NodeJS project.

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository or deploy merged pull requests to production.
